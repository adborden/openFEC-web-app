    The FEC exclusively enforces civil federal campaign finance law. Possible
    violations of the law are identified one of four ways:
  </p>
  <ol class="list--numbered">
    <li>The FEC regularly reviews committee reports and conducts audits.</li>
    <li>Anyone may file a sworn complaint with the FEC that a violation has occurred or is about to occur.</li>
    <li>Other government agencies may refer possible violations to the FEC.</li>
    <li>Any person or entity who believes it has committed a violation may self report to the Commission.</li>

  <h3>Matters Under Review (MURs)</h3>
  <p>
    MURs are standard enforcement cases. By law, the Commission must attempt to
    resolve MURs through a confidential investigative process. If that process
    fails to end with a conciliation agreement, either the Commission or the
    respondent(s) can choose to pursue the matter to court.
  </p>
  <h3>Administrative Fine Program</h3>
  <p>
    Coming soon: The Administrative Fine Program assesses civil money penalties
    for late and non-filed reports.
  </p>
  <h3>Alternative Dispute Resolution Program</h3>
  <p>
    Coming soon: Alternative Dispute Resolution is a series of procedures for
    resolving enforcement disputes through the mutual consent of the parties
    involved.
